		<h2>Alexa controlled dorm lights</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/mdzirbel/Room">GitHub Link</a>
		<p>When my room mate and I started planning our room in the summer of 2018 we decided we wanted to have better lights than the default ones.
		The end goal was to use a laser to put a point on the ceiling and then have paddles on each end. This would allow us to play pong on it.
		We got as far as using it as a general lighting system. You can select scenes and change the color. 
		It runs on a Raspberry Pi and that's why it is written in python.</p>

		<h2>Door Lock</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/Maxfojtik/Door">GitHub Link</a>
		<p>I found that I didn't like carrying around a key to my dorm room all day. So I created a system to lock and unlock my door with my phone.

		<h2>Elite Neopixel Integration</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/Maxfojtik/EliteDangeriousNeopixelIntegration">GitHub Link</a>
		<p>One of my favorite games is Elite Dangerous. I love playing this game and I love LEDs, so I thought I would combine them.
