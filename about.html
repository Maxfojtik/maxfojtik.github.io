			<h3>I write programs, build robots and have fun doing it.</h3>
			<p>In high school I participated in CyberPatriot, STEMnauts, NASA SL, FRC Robotics and more.</p>
            <p>In the CyberPatriot competition my team was challenged to secure computers from threats</p>
            <p>The STEMnauts competition was a challenge from TI, we were tasked with solving ciphers and riddles to achieve points. My team was awarded first place in the nation, this gave me the opportunity to talk to a NASA Astronaut and get free TI calculators.</p>
            <p>NASA SL is an activity that highschool and college students participate in. We built rockets for research and launched them one mile into the air.</p>
            <p>The organization that I spent the most time at was FRC Robotics. We put together robots that compete in a team of 3 to rack up points. The team with the most points at the end of the competition wins</p>
            <p>During the 2019 summer I helped the local Sylvania population servicing computers and teaching computer skills.</p>
