		<h2>Autonomous Airplane Project</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="">[GitHub Link Soon]</a>
		<p>This project started when my friend <a style="font-weight: normal;" href="http://www.mdzirbel.com/">Matthew Zirbel</a> and I wanted to make an autonomous glider that you could throw from the top of a building and glide to a position.
		This ended up not working at all because we are not Aerospace majors, but it did look cool. Fast forward a year and here we are... "Glider" V3.1. This is an airplane completly designed in cad and make out of 3D
		printed parts (anything orange), aluminum extrusion, foam, and thin plastic sheets. There are 3 9g metal gear servos, and 3 5" quadcopter motors. The sensor suite includes a 9 axis IMU, a barametric pressure sensor,
		a GPS module, and an ultrasonic range finder. It communicates to the ground station with a RFM95. Lastly I had to include some WS2812b LEDs. Everything is controlled with a Teensy 3.1.

		<h2>Alexa controlled dorm lights</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/mdzirbel/Room">GitHub Link</a>
		<p>When my room mate and I started planning our room in the summer of 2018 we decided we wanted to have better lights than the default ones.
		The end goal was to use a laser to put a point on the ceiling and then have paddles on each end. This would allow us to play pong on it.
		We got as far as using it as a general lighting system. You can select scenes and change the color. 
		It runs on a Raspberry Pi and that's why it is written in python.</p>

		<h2>Door Lock</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/Maxfojtik/Door">GitHub Link</a>
		<p>I found that I didn't like carrying around a key to my dorm room all day. So I created a system to lock and unlock my door with my phone.
		The door program itself is written in python run from a raspberry pi. There is no server for my phone to connect to but rather the python program queries a database hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
		Then an android app manipulates the database to open and close the lock. This configuration allowed me to learn AWS while also keeping the whole setup "serverless."

		<h2>Elite Neopixel Integration</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/Maxfojtik/EliteDangeriousNeopixelIntegration">GitHub Link</a>
		<p>One of my favorite games is Elite Dangerous. I love playing this game and I love LEDs, so I thought I would combine them.
